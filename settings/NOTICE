Settings Storage

Key-value settings storage.

This is 100% original work, developed by me only.

It supports various data types (integers, floats, booleans, strings, IP addresses), and can automatically convert the settings between the various types.

Multiple storages are supported. For the moment only two types are provided: text and binary. Contact me if you need any other data storage developed.

Cached writes and change notifications are supported.
