MQTT Broker

This is 100% original work, developed by me only.
The only exception is the function isTopicMatched() which originates from Eclipse Paho.

There is a performance issue with this broker.
If it has to close a TCP connection (e.g. dropping a session), the connection will end up in the TCP_WAIT state.
This may eventually exhaust the server's resources, and normally is handled with using SO_LINGER with 0 timeout.
However there is this bug in NuttX: https://github.com/apache/nuttx/issues/7522.

If this issue if fixed, I will be happy to update the server to use this option, and test it.
I would highly prefer to do so before porting to NuttX (as I have the test environment ready for this).

Client authentication is not implemented, there is only a place-holder there.
Feel free to propose an implementation.

Another issue may be the logging of the server, which is not optimal, but it is also not affecting its actual operation.

To create an actual application that runs this server, the function MQTT_Broker_start() in the file mqtt_broker.c should be modified.
I don't expect any modifications in any other file.
