Geolocation service

This software uses the ipgeolocation.io API to get the approximate current location of a device.

Although it is of minimal "coding" importance, I hope it is a useful example of the API and that it may act as an inspiration to someone in need of device geolocation.

It also includes a working example of the JSON lirbary.
