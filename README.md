# Readme

This repository contains a collection of personal codes and libraries that are to be moved into the official [NuttX apps](https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps) repository,
released under the Apache license.

Do not use directly! Rather use the ported code in the official repository. This repository is to be deleted (soon?).

Every directory contains a NOTICE file. Read it before doing any work.  
Please contact me before start porting, to provide you with help and examples, re-check licensing, and coordinate the effort.
Better yet, you may open an issue for the piece of code that you are interested into, so everyone can contribute to the discussion or the porting effort.

Please do not modify the code with improvements or bug fixes. Let's have the code ported first, and then development can follow on the official repo.
